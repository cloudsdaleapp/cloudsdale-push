= Soapbox -- a Twitter-style chat app

Soapbox is a chat app written using Faye and jQuery, with functionality modelled
on that of Twitter. You can pick a username, type in some users to follow, and
enter messages. You receive messages from anyone you're following, and any
messages that mention you using the <tt>@username</tt> syntax.


== Running the demo

There are two backends that handle message routing; one for Node.js and one for
Ruby. To run the Node.js version:

  node examples/node/server.js 8000

To run the Ruby version, run:

  bundle install
  rake example[8000]

You can also run the Ruby demo on several ports and use HAProxy to load balance
between them.

  rake example[7070] &
  rake example[8080] &
  rake example[9090] &
  haproxy -f shared/haproxy.conf

The demo app will then be available on port 3000.


== Source code

There is no server-side logic for this app; the Faye server simply handles
message routing between clients and all subscriptions are set up on the client
side. Since this is a simple demo of client-side messaging, your username and
followees are not persisted across page reloads. The source code for the client
is at:

  shared/public/soapbox.js
