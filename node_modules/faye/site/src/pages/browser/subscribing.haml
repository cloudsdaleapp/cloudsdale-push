    h4. Subscribing to channels
    
    Clients receive data from other clients by subscribing to channels. Whenever
    any client sends a message to a channel you're subscribed to, Faye will
    notify your client with the new message.
    
    Channel names must be formatted as absolute path names whose segments may
    contain only letters, numbers, and the symbols @-@, @_@, @!@, @~@, @(@, @)@,
    @$@ and @@@. Channel names may also end with wildcards:
       
    * The @*@ wildcard matches any channel segment. So @/foo/*@ matches @/foo/bar@
      and @/foo/thing@ but not @/foo/bar/thing@.
    * The @**@ wildcard matches any channel name recursively. So @/foo/**@
      matches @/foo/bar@, @/foo/thing@ and @/foo/bar/thing@.
    
    So for example if you subscribe to @/foo/*@ and someone sends a message to
    @/foo/bar@, you will receive that message.
    
    Clients should subscribe to channels using the @#subscribe()@ method:
    
    <pre class="prettyprint">var subscription = client.subscribe('/foo', function(message) {
      // handle message
    });</pre>
    
    The subscriber function will be invoked when anybody sends a message to
    @/foo@, and the @message@ parameter will contain the sent message object. A
    client may bind multiple listeners to a channel, and the Faye client handles
    all the management of those listeners and makes sure the server sends it the
    right messages.
    
    The @subscribe()@ method returns a @Subscription@ object, which you can
    cancel if you want to remove that listener from the channel.
    
    <pre class="prettyprint">subscription.cancel();</pre>
    
    It also lets you add callbacks that will run as soon as the subcription has
    been set up and acknowledged by the server:
    
    <pre class="prettyprint">subscription.callback(function() {
      alert('Subscription is now active!');
    });</pre>
    
    If there was an error creating the subscription, you can detect this using
    an errback:
    
    <pre class="prettyprint">subscription.errback(function(error) {
      alert(error.message);
    });</pre>
