    h4. Extensions
    
    Both the server and client support an extension mechanism that lets you
    intercept messages as they pass in and out. This lets you modify messages
    for any purpose you like, including messages on @/meta/*@ channels that are
    used by the protocol. An extension is just an object that has either an
    @incoming()@ or @outgoing()@ method (or both). These methods should accept a
    message and a callback function, and should call the function with the
    message once they have made any modifications.
    
    Extensions use a callback instead of simply returning the modified message
    since this allows you to use asynchronous logic to make your modifications.
    
    As an example, suppose we want to authenticate subscription messages by
    checking an authentication token against a list we're keeping in a file on
    disk. Clients subscribe to channels by sending a message to the
    @/meta/subscribe@ channel with the channel they want to subscribe in the
    @subscription@ field. Let's say our authentication file contains a JSON
    object that maps channels to required tokens:
    
    <pre class="prettyprint">// tokens.json
    
    {
      "/users/jcoglan/updates": "rt6utrb",
      "/artists/mclusky/news":  "99taaec"
    }</pre>
    
    The server can validate subscription messages by checking that they have the
    right auth token attached. By convention, data added by extensions is stored
    in the message's @ext@ field.
    
    <pre class="prettyprint">var fs = require('fs');
    
    var serverAuth = {
      incoming: function(message, callback) {
        // Let non-subscribe messages through
        if (message.channel !== '/meta/subscribe')
          return callback(message);
        
        // Get subscribed channel and auth token
        var subscription = message.subscription,
            msgToken     = message.ext && message.ext.authToken;
        
        // Find the right token for the channel
        fs.readFile('./tokens.json', function(err, content) {
          var registry = JSON.parse(content.toString()),
              token    = registry[subscription];
          
          // Add an error if the tokens don't match
          if (token !== msgToken)
            message.error = 'Invalid subscription auth token';
          
          // Call the server back now we're done
          callback(message);
        });
      }
    };
    
    bayeux.addExtension(serverAuth);</pre>
    
    If you add an @error@ property to a message, the server will not process the
    message further and will simply return it to the sender, effectively
    blocking the subscription attempt. You should always make sure your
    extension calls the @callback@, as failing to do so could block delivery of
    other messages in the same request.
    
    *When implementing authentication, remember that a message published to
    channel @/foo/bar/qux@ will be routed to subscriptions to @/foo/bar/qux@,
    @/foo/bar/*@, @/foo/bar/**@, @/foo/**@ and @/**@. Take appropriate measures
    in your extensions to correctly authenticate subscriptions.*
    
    On the client side, you'll need to make sure the client sends the right auth
    token to satisfy the server. We do this by adding an _outgoing_ extension on
    the client side.
    
    <pre class="prettyprint">var clientAuth = {
      outgoing: function(message, callback) {
        // Again, leave non-subscribe messages alone
        if (message.channel !== '/meta/subscribe')
          return callback(message);
        
        // Add ext field if it's not present
        if (!message.ext) message.ext = {};
        
        // Set the auth token
        message.ext.authToken = 'rt6utrb';
        
        // Carry on and send the message to the server
        callback(message);
      }
    };
    
    client.addExtension(clientAuth);</pre>
    
    If an extension has an @added()@ method, that will be called when the
    extension is added to its host. To remove an extension, call:
    
    <pre class="prettyprint">// Calls extension.removed() if defined
    hostObject.removeExtension(extension);</pre>
    
    To write extensions you'll need to know what kinds of messages are used by
    the Bayeux protocol; see "the specification":http://svn.cometd.com/trunk/bayeux/bayeux.html
    for more details.
